# Rust Block Chain
Welcome to the Rust Block Chain project! This Rust application provides a basic implementation of a blockchain, a distributed and decentralized ledger technology. With the Rust Block Chain, users can explore the fundamental concepts of blockchain, including blocks, transactions, mining, and consensus algorithms.

## Features
1. **Blockchain Data Structure:** Implements a data structure to represent a blockchain, consisting of blocks linked together in a chain.

2. **Block Creation:** Allows for the creation of new blocks containing a list of transactions.

3. **Transaction Management:** Handles transactions, including their validation and inclusion in blocks.

4. **Mining:** Implements a basic Proof of Work (PoW) mining algorithm to find valid block hashes.

5. **Consensus:** Implements a simple consensus mechanism to ensure agreement on the valid blockchain among network nodes.

6. **Persistence:** Provides functionality to store the blockchain data persistently on disk.

## Installation
To run the Rust Block Chain application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/Rust_block_chain.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Rust_block_chain

3. **Build the Application:** Build the Rust binary for the blockchain node using Cargo, the Rust package manager:

cargo build --release

## Usage
1. **Start the Node:** Run the built binary to start the blockchain node:

cargo run --release

2. **Interact with the Node:** Use the provided command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the blockchain node, such as creating transactions, mining blocks, or checking the current blockchain status.

3. **View Blockchain Information:** Use the CLI commands to view information about the blockchain, including block height, transaction history, and current balances.

4. **Connect Multiple Nodes:** Optionally, run multiple instances of the blockchain node on different machines or ports to create a network of nodes and test consensus mechanisms.

## Customization
1. **Consensus Algorithm:** Customize the consensus algorithm to implement different consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake (PoS) or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).

2. **Transaction Types:** Extend the application to support different types of transactions or smart contracts, allowing for more complex use cases on the blockchain.

3. **Security Enhancements:** Implement additional security features such as transaction validation rules, cryptographic signature schemes, or secure communication protocols.
